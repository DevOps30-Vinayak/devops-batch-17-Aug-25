Linux  Operating System
------------------------------------------------------
- for DevOps - Writing Bash Scripts/ Searching and Filtering / Update the configuration files/ Managing Users and accounts/ Install the packages 


Check Installation of WSL Ubuntu
=================================
1. Way 
Machine - Windows 10 Pro + / Windows 11
On Windows ->  Turn Windows On or Off

 - Windows subsystem for Linux
 - Virtual Machine platform 
 - Hyper-V 

Open Powershell -> Run as administrator

wsl --install

or 

Start Menu -> Microsoft Store -> Ubuntu -> Click Get


2. Way -> Oracle Virtual Machine VirtualBox (ubuntu)

3. Way -> Public Cloud (AWS/ Azure) -> VM (Any OS Ubuntu/ Windows)

Cloud :

    - Virtual Machine (Infrastructure)
    - Networking 
    - Storage


3- tier applications : Application is spreaded into layers (Frontend, Backend, Database)

Modern applications requirements:
------------------------------------------------
Architecture of applications - Monolithic vs Microservice architecture

Portability - Running application in any environment (Development (Develop the code), Testing (Unit, Performance, UAT), Production - Deployment + Infrastructure)

Scalability - Increase/decrease the instances of applications 10 Instances --------> 50 Instances (Horizontal scaling)

Vertical scaling  - Increasing the system / machine capacity (Resources - CPU, RAM, Harddisk, Network adapter)


High Availability -  Minimum Down time of applications/servers

Resilience - Application resilience is the ability of an application to react to problems in one of its components and still provide the best possible service.

Linux Architecture

- It is an operating system
- Every application running on Linux is a process 
- Open source 
- Command line interaction

In Linux, the kernel is the fundamental core of the operating system (OS) that acts as the central intermediary between the computer's hardware and software, managing resources like memory, CPU, and devices.

Created by Linus Torvalds, the open-source Linux kernel is the essential component of Linux-based systems

User (use shell program) ---------------------> KERNEL -------------------> Resources (RAM, CPU, HDD)
 Linux programs (commands)


Linux utilities - Package manager, Devices Drivers, Compiler (gcc)

package manager - install / uninstall the packages/ software in Linux distribution.


Tool              Package Manager
Java              Maven
Node             NPM
.NET              Nuget
Python           PIP
Ubuntu          apt / apt-get           
Centos           yum 
RedHat          rpm         
Debian          apt 
Fedora          dnf
Kali               apt


Linux users
1. Root users / Super user (sudo) - all administrative permissions 
2. Normal User - with restricted access



commands:
$ pwd  - home directory  /home/<username>  (/ - root directory , home - all users home directory , <username> - user)

$ sudo apt install tree

After installing $tree

$ which tree

                                      
variables : to store the value
- user-defined variables
- Environment variables - Linux initialize environment variables

What are environment variables ?
Variables stored in OS, KEY & VALUE pairs
